# Playtime Leaderboard (v0.2)

A Minecraft Forge mod for version 1.19.2 & 1.20.1 that adds a `/playtime` command to display playtime statistics for all players (online and offline) on a server or singleplayer world. The mod provides a detailed, formatted leaderboard with customizable colors, podium ranks, and alignment for an enhanced user experience.

### All mods are Server-Side (not required on client)

## Features

### `/playtime` Command
- **Accessible to All Players**: Requires no permission, so anyone can use it.
- **Shows Playtime for All Players**:
  - Displays playtime for both online and offline players.
  - Hover over the hours display to see the time spent on this world today (Reset time can be edited in config)
  - Sorts players by playtime in descending order (highest to lowest).
  - Setting colors for specific usernames and blacklisting players from leaderboard is possible in the config (see `Configuration`)

### Formatting
- **Days Display**:
  - For players with 100+ hours, shows days in parentheses (e.g., `(54.17d)`).
- **Hours Decimal Display**:
  - Below 1000h: Displays hours with 2 decimal places (e.g., `493.15h`).
  - At or above 1000h: Displays hours as integers (e.g., `1300h`).
- **Color Coding**:
